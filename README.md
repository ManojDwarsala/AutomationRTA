Automation of Regression Testing Analysis through Python Scripting and Visualizing through XML

Problem Description:-
Whenever a Regression-Testing has been performed on a particular device, a huge log-file with more than 6 lakh lines ( size > 80MB ) is generated. Manually analyzing the log file is time-consuming and also prone to errors. Thus the goal is to automate the analysis of log files by generating a one-page report containing the summary of the entire log file. The summary includes the number of test cases passed and failed for each type of test methods. It also provides a visual representation of the trend of tests performed on the device. Leveraged Jenkins tool to automatically run the script whenever a new log file is generated.

Input:- Huge log file generated by performing Regression-Testing (around 80-100MB in size, more than 6Lakh lines)
Output:- One-page summary reporting the number of test cases failed/passed for each type of tests and also a Visual Representation of trend over past tests.
  
Description of Solution:-
TestSummary.py:- script to analyze the input log file and generate a short summary report. Also, it produces XML file output used for 
displaying visual trend.

Other scripts:-
1. reboot.py:- used to reboot the system from a remote desktop without actually going to the site.
2. timeconfig.py:- used to set the time of a system from a remote desktop.
